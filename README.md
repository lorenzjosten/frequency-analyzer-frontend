# Frontend 

This web frontend was created using the web technologies Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite and Bootstrap5.

If the backend is running, mp3 audio files can be uploaded and played. The power spectrum of the current mp3 frame will be shown in a graph created with Plotly.

## Building

The gradle build script is used for building the app as a bundled application. Use yarn to build and bundle the frontend separately.

Build the app for production:
```shell
yarn build
```

## Execution

Run the app in standalone dev mode:
```shell
yarn dev
```
